ðŸ“Š Customer Behavior Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze customer purchasing behavior, satisfaction levels, and spending patterns to uncover insights that drive better decision-making. Using Tableau, an interactive dashboard was created to visualize key metrics, compare trends, and enhance customer engagement strategies.

The dataset contains e-commerce customer transaction records, including:

Customer ID
Total Spend
Days Since Last Purchase
Discount Applied (True/False)
Membership Type (Gold, Bronze, etc.)
Customer Satisfaction Ratings
Gender
Items Purchased
ðŸ“Š Analysis & Visualizations
1. Purchase Recency vs. Total Spend (Line Chart)
Insight: Customers who buy frequently spend significantly more.
Action: Implement customer retention strategies to maintain engagement.
2. Discount Impact Analysis (Bar Chart with Membership Filter)
Insight:
Gold members spend more without discounts (â‚¹1,460 vs. â‚¹1,165).
Bronze members spend more when discounts are applied (â‚¹500 with discounts).
Action: Apply a tiered discount strategyâ€”focus discounts on Bronze members while offering exclusive perks for Gold members.
3. Top Customers by Total Spend (Dynamic Table)
Insight: Customer ID 110 is the highest spender (â‚¹1,520).
Action: Use personalized loyalty programs to retain high-value customers.
4. Gender-Based Purchasing Analysis (Table)

ðŸ“Œ Insights & Key Takeaways
Frequent buyers drive the highest revenue, making customer retention crucial.
Discounts should be targetedâ€”they work well for Bronze members but aren't necessary for Gold members.
High-value customers (e.g., ID 110) should receive personalized offers to enhance loyalty.
Male customers are more active buyers, presenting a growth opportunity among female customers.
ðŸ“¢ Conclusion
This Tableau dashboard provides a data-driven approach to customer segmentation, discount effectiveness, and spending behavior. The insights help businesses optimize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance overall profitability.
